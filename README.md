Flight Cancellation Classifier

For an in-class kaggle competition, I analyzed 98,893 flights across the United States to explore characteristics that help predict flight cancellation. I then implemented random forests, XGBoost, SVMs, and discriminant analysis to identify best performing model, and tuned random forests parameters to improve testing accuracy from 94% to 99.85% to achieve the final model. s
