## Flight Cancellation Classifier

I analyzed 98,893 flights across the United States to explore characteristics that help predict flight cancellation. I then implemented random forests, XGBoost, SVMs, and discriminant analysis to identify the best performing model, and tuned random forest parameters to improve testing accuracy from 94% to 99.84% to achieve the final model.
